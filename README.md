spotify-lyrics

This small shell script uses Spotify-now( https://github.com/micahco/spotify-now ), MusixMatch API( https://developer.musixmatch.com/ ), jq( https://stedolan.github.io/jq/ )perl and curl to provide lyrics in CLI.

Simply clone and run this shell script ( sh ./newmain.sh )and it will display lyrics for you (provided Spotify is running and playing.)
